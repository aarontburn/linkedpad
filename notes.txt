connected to PC -> Disconnected from PC -> Off

disconnected from PC -> connected to PC -> Booting


Pi booted -> Software not booted
	Flash yellow?


Pi booted -> Software finished booting
	Send Pi Ready



if serial connection isn't established ->
	- every second, if software is not already connected, scan for the port. 

once port is open ->
	- listen to pi_ready from the pad. once pi_ready is heard, consider the pi connected.
	
once pi is connected ->
	- every five seconds, if pi_ready hasn't been received, consider the pi disconnected,
	- On software exit, send pc_exit to pi, which will return it to database mode.
	- On Pi software exit, send pi_exit to PC, which will consider the pi disconnected

On Pi disconnected ->
	- return to waiting for pi_ready
	


Pi Boot Cycle
	Plugged in
	- Run python program to create a loading wheel with the buttons
	- Once <some condition> is met, stop the loading animation
	- Initialize the LEDHandler, GPIOHandler, WiFiHHandler

	
	Software started
	- If Wifi is connected, or once wifi is connected:
		- Start DatabaseHandler
	- If 'pc_ready' has been received from PC:
		- Toggle some boolean to have events handled by PC
		- Block DatabaseHandler



	- If 'pc_exit' has been received:
		- Unblock DatabaseHandler
	
	- On software exit or crash:
		- Attempt 'pi_exit' to PC






States:


Pi is booting -> Maybe write a program to toggle the lights and stops once the main program is booted?

Pi started software but is not connected to PC
	- Wifi Connected -> Work as standalone linked pad
				- Continuously check wifi connection every ~5 seconds.
					- If wifi disconnects, flash header buttons red.
						- Once reconnected, reconnect database and proceed
		
	- Wifi Not Connected -> Flash red at low brightness
